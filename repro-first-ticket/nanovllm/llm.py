"""LLM entry placeholder for T0-1 incremental bootstrap.

Why this file now:
- `LLM` is the main user-facing object in the original project design.
- Adding it early gives a stable anchor for subsequent files (`sampling_params.py`, engine modules).
- This keeps progress tangible while respecting one-file-per-change.
